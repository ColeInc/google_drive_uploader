# Google Drive Uploader

Powershell + Python scripts that will allow me to set certain directories to be polled, and any new files or changes made to this directory from now on will be uploaded to a defined google drive directory automatically.

## Resources:

pip install pydrive
pip install watchdog (don't know if i'll use this 100% yet)
